Description: Bridge metapackage for HaLOS APT repository migration
 This is a transitional bridge package that migrates the APT source
 from apt.hatlabs.fi to apt.halos.fi.
 .
 On installation, it adds the apt.halos.fi GPG key and APT source.
 On the next apt update && apt upgrade, the system will upgrade to
 the halos package from apt.halos.fi (version 0.3.0+).
 .
 This package has identical dependencies to halos 0.2.10 to prevent
 any packages from being auto-removed during the transition.
