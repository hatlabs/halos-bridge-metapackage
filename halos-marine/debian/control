Description: Bridge metapackage for HaLOS marine APT repository migration
 This is a transitional bridge package for halos-marine that maintains
 identical dependencies to halos-marine 0.2.10 during the migration
 from apt.hatlabs.fi to apt.halos.fi.
 .
 This package has identical dependencies to halos-marine 0.2.10 to prevent
 any packages from being auto-removed during the transition.
